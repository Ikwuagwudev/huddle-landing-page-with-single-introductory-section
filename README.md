# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section

![Design preview for the Huddle landing page with single introductory section](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is a solution to my second project given to me by TECHATHON COMMUNITY [Huddle landing page with single introductory section] as a Frontend Developer

## The challenge

I use Html and Css to build this Huddle landing page

## Building the project

 Below is a suggested process I used in building this project:

1. I used HTML5 markup Semantics, that is, I group it into 3 sections: 
a.  The header
b.  The main and;
c.  The footer

2. I also make use of css variables 

:root {
  --violet: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
  --softMagenta: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
  --poppins-400-600: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
  --open-sans-400: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  }
  
3. Also use;
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## Deploying my project

I was able to deploy my project using GitHub Pages. Check out my live project below at github.io.

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  :root {
  --violet: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
  --softMagenta: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
  --poppins-400-600: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
  --open-sans-400: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  }
}

.learnt this newly {
object-fit: contain;
}

### Continued development

I want to master media queries and flexbox very well.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing resource. It explained css grids, flexbox and how to center <div> well. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - This is an amazing resource where I got all the fonts I used for my project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning web development.
